# epNFT Standard: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction to epNFTs
Welcome to the `epNFT-standard` repository, where we explore the first program-owned NFT standard that leverages Instruction Introspection and Transfer Hooks. This standard introduces an Allowlist-based mechanism, designed meticulously to ensure that only approved Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) and Instructions are executed!

## Core Principles of epNFTs
The operation of epNFTs is grounded in two key principles:
1. **Origin Verification**: At its core, epNFTs scrutinize the origin of each Transfer instruction to safeguard against unauthorized CPI by non-approved programs.
2. **Instruction Compliance**: Furthermore, epNFTs conduct a thorough examination of the transaction's instructions to verify adherence to the established Allowlist rules, ensuring that every transaction aligns with the intended standards and practices.

## Rationale Behind a New Standard
The creation of the epNFT standard was driven by two primary motivations:
- To empower creators to select Token2022 as the "home" for their NFT creating Enforced Royalty as the first Ruleset
- To set the stage for more institutional applications in the future that will require stricter usage control of tokens like RWA & other

## Conclusion
The `epNFT-standard` represents a significant step forward in the evolution of NFT technology, offering unprecedented levels of control and flexibility for creators. As this standard continues to evolve, we anticipate it will unlock new possibilities and applications for NFTs that extend far beyond the current landscape.
